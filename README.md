# CPP to Python Migrating

## Target Audience
The tutorial was written for students who took one of the following Computer Science courses in ETH’s Basisjahr: 252-0832-00L, 252-0848-00L, 252-0847-00L and 252-0856-00L. Consequently, this migration tutorial roughly follows the order in which different topics were presented in these courses, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with them. Moreover, the tutorial regularly contrasts equivalent C++ and Python programs, in order to help understanding the latter.

## Goals and Non-Goals
This tutorial was written under the assumption that the reader (1) has a specific programming task to solve, (2) remembers from their Basisjahr course which general concepts and/or C++-specific language features might help solving the task, but (3) does not yet know a suitable Python counterpart. The tutorial assumes Python 3.6 and higher, but typically will not use features that have been added very recently (i.e. at the time of writing, from Python 3.9).

This tutorial does not try to provide a general, self-contained introduction to Python. It also does not try to enumerate all possible alternatives, e.g. for formatting a string, which matches our policy from the C++ Basisjahr courses. Moreover, in order to keep the programs closer to those you know from your C++ lecture(s), the Python programs presented here may not always be the most idiomatic (pythonic) way of solving a problem in Python. Lastly, the tutorial does not enumerate or suggest Python libraries, nor does it explain how to use popular libraries.

As always, it is strongly recommended to play with the code snippets, change them, test when things break, etc. This is crucial for learning any programming language — just as it is crucial to speak, and not just listen, in order to learn a human language.

## Further Resources
A plethora of resources for learning and mastering Python exist, and likewise for applying particular Python libraries (e.g. Panda or NumPy) in particular problem domains (e.g. data analysis or scientific computing). The following list enumerates a few resources suitable for beginners, with no claim of exhaustiveness:
